JAMES REVEX

"Industrial. Bloody. Madness incarnate."

Era: Post-War England, 1952-1958

Location: Birmingham, Industrial Midlands

Context: England rebuilding after World War II, factories operating at maximum capacity, rationing ending, but

deep social scars remain. An era of "reconstruction" that hides unprocessed trauma.

üè≠ REFINED CORE CONCEPT

James Revex isn't just a man with an engine in his chest‚Äîhe is the living embodiment of trauma as fuel. A

meditation on how survival destroys, how strength creates addiction, and how sometimes the "cure" is worse

than the disease. He is Birmingham made flesh: brutal, tireless, eternally burning itself to keep functioning.

Central Paradox: James was saved by something that's slowly killing him. He hates the engine, but is addicted

to the power it provides. Each use of the engine consumes part of his humanity‚Äîliterally.

üß† COMPLEX PSYCHOLOGY

The Fragmented Triad

James doesn't exist in simple duality, but in three conflicting personas:

1. The Silenced Boy (The Past)

Twenty years of repressed emotions

Memories of forced clarity and terrible simplicity

Toxic nostalgia: "When everything was forbidden, at least it was simple"

Secret: James sometimes desperately wishes to return to that quietness

2. The Demonized Engine (The Present)

Mechanical explosion of decades of repression

Power addiction: the almost sexual ecstasy when hitting Redline

Hidden truth: James exaggerates his lack of control because it's easier to be a monster than a broken man

3. The Operator (The Persona)

The performative identity he uses to survive

Purposeful dissociation: "It's not me, it's the machine"

Humanity Impostor Syndrome: Pretends to be less human than he is to avoid facing guilt and longing

Detailed Psychological Mechanisms

Addictive Hypercompensation: James doesn't just react to decades of immobility‚Äîhe's addicted to the

sensation. The engine at Redline produces a neurochemical discharge that nothing else in his life has ever

matched. After each power explosion, there's a period of euphoria where he feels invincible, followed by deep

depression when the engine returns to idle.

Strategic Dissociation: James refers to his body as "the machine" not by accident, but for psychological self-

preservation. When the engine does something horrible, it was "the machine." When he feels pleasure in

destruction, it was "the engine." This protects him from guilt... but also prevents him from growing.

Paradoxical Terror of Quietness: James climbs to rooftops at 3 AM trying to remember what silence was like.

For 10-15 seconds, he almost succeeds. Then panic hits him like a train‚Äîsilence now means death‚Äîand the

engine SCREAMS back. He repeats this every night anyway, like someone testing a wound.

Memory as Machine: James doesn't remember visually‚Äîhe remembers through industrial sounds:

Kettle whistle = first time he nearly died (panic attack at 8 years old)

Rhythmic hammering = mother's heartbeat when she hugged him

Grinding gears = father's voice (worked with metal 14 hours/day)

Total silence = imminent death

üìú EXPANDED ORIGIN

Before: "The Quiet Boy" (1932-1952)

Historical Context: James was born during the Great Depression, grew up during wartime rationing.

Handsworth, Birmingham‚Äîa working-class neighborhood where childhood silence was virtue, not symptom.

Family:

Father: Thomas Revex, foundry worker. Died in 1944 (workplace accident). James was 12 and couldn't cry

at the funeral‚Äîhis heart couldn't take it.

Mother: Elizabeth Revex, textile factory seamstress. Developed selective mutism around James to avoid

"agitating him." Died in 1950 (pneumonia). James watched her waste away, unable to scream for help when

she collapsed.

Defining Childhood:

8 years old (1940): Nearly died during panic attack after screaming with joy when father returned on military

leave. Spent three days between life and death. Developed habit of "counting beats"‚Äîobsessively monitoring

own pulse.

12 years old (1944): Father dies. James doesn't cry at funeral. Repressed emotion manifests in nosebleed

lasting two hours.

15 years old (1947): Creates elaborate inner world: "Kingdom of Machines," where he's absolute sovereign

conquering imaginary factories. Draws impossible machines in notebook hidden under mattress. It's the only

thing that survives the transformation.

18 years old (1950): Mother dies. James finds her on floor, still breathing, but can't scream for help (neighbors

are close but don't hear). She dies while he holds her hand in forced silence. This is the trauma that never leaves

him.

The Steel Works: Hadley & Sons Steel Works (1950-1952)

James gets work as "temperature monitor"‚Äîstays in isolated booth recording measurements. Sedentary, safe,

solitary.

But: Secretly, he loves the roar of furnaces. Spends lunch breaks near blast furnace, feeling heat, hearing

thunder of molten metal. It's the only time his weak heart seems adequate‚Äîjust another gear in a greater

symphony.

Deterioration: In February 1952, doctors say he has 6 months, maybe less. Heart failing rapidly. James begins

approaching furnace dangerously close, in suicidal fascination. "If I'm going to die, let it be quick. Let it be hot.

Let it be loud."

The Accident: "The Forging" (March 15, 1952)

11:47 AM. Blast furnace explosion. Later investigation suggests union sabotage, but truth is simpler: James was

too close, wanting too much.

The explosion was almost a relief. Finally, something louder than his heart's controlled beats.

James wakes three days later. Not in hospital‚Äîin improvised mechanical workshop in factory basement.

The Creator: Silas Crowther

Complete Profile:

67 years old, WWII veteran (tank mechanic, African Campaign)

Lost son (Robert, 19 years old) at Dunkirk, 1940

Robert had congenital heart disease, survived childhood but died in combat (heart gave out under stress)

Unprocessed trauma: Silas blames himself for not "fixing" his son

Real Motivation: Silas didn't see James‚Äîhe saw second chance to save Robert. The "salvation" was always

about displaced paternal grief. James was wrong patient in right place with right face.

Methodology: In delirium of grief and genius, Silas didn't try to save James's heart‚Äîhe replaced it using:

Morris Minor 1934 engine (same car Robert drove)

Factory steam piping

Bronze valves from German naval torpedo (war scrap)

Improvised neural connectors with telegraph wire

Quote during surgery (delirious): "If the boy's ticker can't keep up with his spirit, we'll give 'im an engine that

can. Robert would've wanted this. Robert would've... my boy... my brilliant boy..."

James never knew about Robert. Silas never told.

üíÄ DETAILED VISUAL DESIGN

Anatomy of Transformation

Engine Specifications:

Base: Morris Minor 4-cylinder, 918cc, brutally modified

Style: Mechanical Frankenstein‚Äîclearly patched, not elegant

Materials: Brass, copper, bronze (due to post-war availability)

Integration: Engine fused with ribcage, valves connected to main arteries

The Chest: Not a "hole"‚Äîit's living combustion chamber. Engine is fused with muscle and bone. Through

opening, you see:

Pistons beating in sync with neural impulses

Bronze valves pulsing like second heart

Oil mixed with blood circulating

Blue sparks when neurons fire

Resting Temperature: 45¬∞C (109¬∞F)‚Äîtoo hot for prolonged touch, not unbearable

Narrative Scars

Each mark tells specific story:

1. Horizontal line on throat: Nearly died from asphyxiation during improvised surgery (Silas had to perform

emergency tracheotomy)

2. Lightning pattern on chest: Where neural connectors were implanted (12 points, looking like broken

clock)

3. Spiral burns on arms: Self-inflicted in first days when trying to literally rip engine out (still scarring, skin

never returned to normal)

4. Bite mark on left shoulder: Where he bit himself to avoid screaming during first overload (teeth went

through muscle)

5. Missing eyebrows/eyelashes: Permanently burned during first Redline

Evolutionary Visual States

IDLE MODE (800-1200 RPM):

Light steam escaping through nostrils

Almond-shaped eyes, normal pupils

Reddened but recognizable skin

Rhythmic breathing: huff-huff-wheeze-huff

Constant hand tremor (engine never 100% stable)

REV UP (1200-4000 RPM):

Sparks jump between teeth when speaking

Smoke darkens, smell of burning oil

Eyes begin glowing (reflection of internal fire)

Intense ruddy skin, sweat evaporates immediately

Voice distorts, becomes metallic

REDLINE (4000-6500 RPM):

Entire body becomes walking furnace

Hair (what little remains) smolders

Saliva boils, tears evaporate before falling

Eyes are pure embers

Ground beneath feet heats, melts rubber soles

Visible ecstasy: James smiles during Redline, even while screaming

STALL (Engine fails):

Body cools rapidly to 37¬∞C

Uncontrollable tremor (shock)

Cadaverous pallor

Returns to boy's fragility for 1-6 hours

This is his greatest terror

General Aesthetic (1950s Dieselpunk)

Visual Inspirations:

British factory worker (not "hero," laborer)

Exposed engine as unhealed war wound

Clothing: Oil-stained work trousers, suspenders, no shirt (impossible to wear‚Äîheat + engine)

Military surplus boots (only thing that doesn't melt)

Key Contrast: Deteriorated human body vs. metal polished by constant use. Engine is impeccable (because it

always works), but James is falling apart around it.

‚öô POWER SYSTEM: REFINED MECHANICS

Emotional Fuel: The Core System

GOLDEN RULE: Each burned emotion is temporarily consumed. James literally cannot feel that emotion for

hours/days after using it as fuel.

Fuel Types

HATRED (Premium Gasoline)

Duration: 15-30 minutes sustained power

Potency: High

Consequence: 6-12 hours emotional apathy post-use

Risk: If burns all hatred, becomes vulnerable to manipulation

FEAR (Diesel)

Duration: 30-60 minutes endurance

Potency: Medium but stable

Consequence: 12-24 hours without survival instinct (extreme danger)

Risk: Can make suicidal choices without realizing

JOY (Alcohol/Ethanol)

Duration: 5-10 explosive minutes

Potency: Very high but erratic

Consequence: 2-4 days deep depression

Risk: James rarely has joy to burn

SADNESS (Crude Oil)

Duration: Hours, but low power

Potency: Basic sustenance

Consequence: Generalized emotional numbness

Risk: Can get "stuck" in flat state indefinitely

LOVE (Nitro/Nitroglycerin)

Duration: 30 seconds apocalyptic power

Potency: Maximum absolute

Consequence: 3-7 days unable to feel love for person/thing

Risk: Can permanently destroy relationships

James only used it once‚Äîand never forgave himself

Narrative Moment: The Day James Burned Love

1954. Child trapped under rubble. Only James can lift it, but he's in idle, no strong emotional fuel available.

He thinks of Sarah (the Human Anchor, see Relationships section). Engine recognizes. Offers.

James hesitates. Knows what happens. Does it anyway.

Engine hits 7500 RPM‚Äînever before recorded. James lifts three tons of concrete alone. Saves child. Hailed as

hero.

Returns home. Sarah hugs him, crying with relief. "Thought I'd lost you."

James feels nothing. Nothing. He hugs back, but it's performance. For six days, he can't remember why he loves

her. She notices. She knows. He never explains.

"That was the day I learned: there's no heroism without cost. And sometimes the cost is the very reason you

wanted to be a hero."

RPM Emotional: Correspondence

800 RPM: Extreme physical pain (engine shouldn't be this low)

1000-1500 RPM: Forced calm, meditative, vulnerable

1500-3000 RPM: James's "normal" state (restless, talkative)

3000-4500 RPM: Agitated, aggressive, looking for fight

4500-6000 RPM: Rage/euphoria, highly dangerous

6000-7000 RPM: Official Redline, imminent overload

7000+ RPM: Guaranteed catastrophic failure

Specific Abilities

THERMAL OVERLOAD

Increases body temperature to 200¬∞C for 30-90 seconds

Uses: Melt metal, cauterize wounds, create heat barrier

Cost: Burns muscle as supplemental fuel

After-effect: Muscle weakness for days, possible fibrosis

MECHANICAL SYNC

Instinctively understands any machinery by touch

Not supernatural‚Äîit's mechanical empathy

Can "hear" what's wrong in engines

Feels pain when machines are mistreated (literally)

Details: James cries when passing junkyards

PRESSURE RELEASE

Expels steam under high pressure through body valves

Locations: Mouth, nostrils, chest valves, pores (in emergency)

Uses: Propulsion (4-5 meter jumps), directional attacks, create smoke screen

Risk: Internal burns, extreme dehydration

ENGINE ROAR

Scream sounding like V12 engine at maximum rotation

Frequency: 110-130 decibels

Effects: Breaks glass, disorients humans, causes nausea

Range: 50 meter radius

Cost: Nose/ear bleeding after prolonged use

REDLINE EUPHORIA (Passive/Curse)

During Redline, James feels uncontrollable ecstasy

Not choice‚Äîit's neurochemical response

Creates addiction: more he uses Redline, more he wants to use

Vicious cycle: Uses Redline ‚Üí Feels pleasure ‚Üí Feels guilt ‚Üí Burns guilt as fuel ‚Üí Uses Redline again

Failure System: Mechanical Russian Roulette

WARNING SIGNS (James recognizes):

1. Oil taste in mouth (compromised filter)

2. Left arm tremor (cylinder #3 failing)

3. Blurred vision (cerebral overheating)

4. Engine "coughs"‚Äîaudible cylinder failure

CRITICAL FAILURES:

Stuck Valve:

Pain like dagger in chest

Impossible to breathe normally

Needs manual "restart" (punching own chest)

Steam Leak:

Internal burn

Bleeding through mouth

Risk of cooking organs from inside out

Complete Stall:

Engine stops completely

James returns to boy's fragility

Duration: 1-6 hours

During stall: Vulnerable, terrified, almost defenseless

Needs "external start" (electric shock, extreme emotion, or manual restart)

Narrative Moment: The First Stall

June 1952, three months after transformation. James fighting corrupt union thugs. Dominating easily. Feeling

invincible.

Then: oil taste. Tremor. Shit.

He has 30 seconds. Tries to finish quickly. Can't. Engine STOPS.

James collapses. Thug leader notices, approaches slowly. James tries to stand‚Äîlegs won't obey. Heart (what's

left of it) barely beats.

Leader: "Not so tough now, are ya, freak?"

James, whispering (for first time in months): "...please..."

Saved only because Sarah appears with shotgun. But humiliation? That never leaves.

"That's when I learned: engine didn't make me strong. Made me dependent."

Necessary Maintenance

James needs:

Special oil: Mixture Silas created (castor oil + glycerin + ???)

Monthly cleaning: Remove carbon deposits (painful, 3-4 hours)

Valve adjustment: Every 3 months (only Silas or very specific mechanic)

Constant emotional fuel: Can never be completely "empty"

Critical Vulnerability: Cold water in quantity. Submersion can cause thermal shock and immediate stall.

üó£ LANGUAGE AND DIALOGUE (British English, Birmingham Accent)

Speech Patterns

James speaks in mechanical bursts:

Phrases interrupted by heavy breathing

Sudden pauses when engine "coughs"

Verbal accelerations when RPM rises

Birmingham slang + 1950s industrial terminology

Phonetic accent:

"Mate" becomes "m8"

"You" becomes "ya" or "yow"

"Nothing" becomes "nothin'" or "nowt"

"Going to" becomes "gonna" or "gunna"

Dialogue Library

NORMAL STATE (2000 RPM):

"Right then, listen 'ere, mate... [huff-huff] ...this bloody contraption in me chest... [wheeze] ...it don't fancy

standing still, does it? Needs to keep moving... keep burning... or I'm brown bread, innit?"

"Y'know what's funny? [motor purrs] Twenty years I couldn't even shout when I stubbed me toe. Now? Now I

can't whisper when I want to say... [hesitates] ...when I need to say... [motor stutters] ...Christ, I can't even

remember what quiet sounds like anymore."

ENTERING OVERLOAD (3500+ RPM):

"Oh, bloody hell... can you feel that? [breathing quickens] The pressure building up? [sparks between teeth]

Like a boiler about to blow its top! INDUSTRIAL... [BANG] ...FUCKING... [CRASH] ...MADNESS!"

"Here it comes, here it comes, HERE IT COMES! [motor roaring] Twenty years of silence concentrated into

one beautiful, terrible SCREAM!"

RARE VULNERABILITY MOMENT:

"You think I like this? You think I wake up every morning grateful to be a fucking kettle with legs? [long pause]

...Sometimes I go up to the roof. 3 AM. Try to remember what silence was. For ten seconds, I almost can. Then

the panic hits and the motor screams back to life and I... [voice breaks] ...I don't know if I'm remembering or if

I'm mourning."

"Me mum died in me arms. Did I tell you that? She was lying there, still breathing, and I couldn't scream for

help because me heart couldn't take it. She died in silence because I was too weak to break it. [motor revs

involuntarily] Now I can't shut up. Funny how that works, innit?"

CONFRONTING THE PAST:

"You think this is about anger? [motor snarls] This is about twenty years of 'shush now, James'... 'calm down,

James'... 'your heart can't take it, James.' Well, guess what? [engines revving] Me heart can take ANYTHING

now. Anything! 'Cept maybe peace. Can't take that. That'd kill me faster than any bullet."

IN COMBAT:

"Come on then, you slag! [pistons firing] Let's see if you can handle Birmingham steel and Coventry chrome!

I'm not just a man anymore... I'm a bloody machine with a twenty-year grudge!"

"INDUSTRIAL! [BANG] BLOODY! [CRASH] MADNESS! [ROAR] INCARNATE!"

POST-COMBAT (guilt/exhaustion):

"[motor at idle, smoking] ...Did you see me smile? During? I was smiling. I felt it. That's... that's not right, is it?

Feeling good about... [silence] ...I think there's something wrong with me. Something more than the obvious."

TALKING ABOUT ENGINE:

"It's not just in me chest, see? It's in me head. Every thought has an RPM now. Calm thoughts? 1500, maybe.

Angry? 4000 easy. And love... [pause] ...love redlines me faster than hate ever could. That's the cruelest bit,

innit? The best things are the most dangerous."

ABOUT SILAS:

"He saved me. [pause] Or killed me. Haven't worked out which yet. Maybe both. Maybe that's the point‚Äî

maybe being saved and being killed are the same thing when you're desperate enough."

ABOUT INTIMACY:

"You wanna know why I don't get close to people? [holds up hand] Put your hand here. Come on. [person

touches] Feel that? 45 degrees. That's me being calm. Imagine me excited. Imagine me angry. Imagine me in

bed. [bitter pause] I'd cook you from the inside out, love. I'm a walking oven with a pulse."

ICONIC PHRASES (Catchphrases):

"Industrial. Bloody. Madness incarnate!"

"Twenty years silent, now I'll never shut up!"

"Me chest don't beat... it bloody detonates!"

"Clothes are for people who ain't on fire inside."

"Hell wouldn't take me, Heaven couldn't fix me... so Birmingham made me into something new."

"You can't kill what's already died and been rebuilt."

"I'll show you what twenty years of swallowed screams sounds like!"

üë• COMPLEX RELATIONSHIPS

SILAS CROWTHER (The Creator/Surrogate Father)

Central Dynamic: Toxic gratitude mixed with deep resentment.

Current Status (1956): Alive, operating clandestine workshop in Wolverhampton.

Hidden Truth: Silas never told James about Robert (dead son). James doesn't know he was chosen for

resembling someone else.

Power Relationship:

James depends on Silas for specialized maintenance

Silas sees James as "masterpiece" and "son" simultaneously

Silas documents everything about James in detailed diary

Main Conflict: James wants to confront Silas about consent (was unconscious during surgery), but fears

answer. What if Silas says "you were going to die anyway"? What if he's right?

Typical Dialogue:

Silas: "How's the engine running, boy? Any knocking? Misfires?"

James: "Don't call me 'boy'. And it's YOUR engine, innit? You should know."

Silas: "It's YOUR heart now, James. I just... gave you the tools to use it properly."

James: "Tools? You turned me into a fucking tool."

Silas [genuinely confused]: "I saved your life."

James [motor revving]: "Did you, though? Did you really?"

Future Revelation: James eventually finds Silas's diary. Discovers about Robert. Understands "salvation" was

never about him‚Äîwas about son Silas couldn't save. This breaks something in James, but also explains

everything.

SARAH MITCHELL (The Human Anchor)

Profile:

28 years old (1956)

Mechanical engineer, worked in aircraft factory during war

Suffers from peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage from chemical exposure)‚Äîreduced heat/pain sensitivity

Crucial: Not "love cures all"‚Äîit's "love complicates everything"

How They Met (1953): Sarah was hired for maintenance at factory where James was... "negotiating" with

thugs. She didn't run from him‚Äîwas fascinated by engine. First thing she said: "That's a Morris Minor base,

isn't it? 1934? Christ, who the hell did this to you?"

Relationship Dynamic:

Strengths:

Sarah treats engine as mechanical problem, not metaphor‚Äîstrangely liberating for James

She's not afraid of him (literally‚Äîdamaged nerves + calm personality)

Understands machines better than people, just like James

Problems:

Sarah sometimes encourages him to use Redline because finds it "fascinating"‚Äîdoesn't realize she's

feeding addiction

James is in love with her but terrified of burning that love as fuel again

Physical intimacy complicated: he literally burns sheets, must be extremely careful

Defining Moment: After James burned her love to save child (1954), Sarah notices something's wrong. She

investigates, eventually confronts.

Sarah: "You used me, didn't you? As fuel. That day."

James [can't lie]: "...Yeah."

Sarah: "And you didn't ask."

James: "Child was dying. Didn't have time‚Äî"

Sarah: "That's not the point, James. The point is that you burned something of mine without permission. You

used my love for you as... as petrol."

James: [silence. Engine at low idle, sound of guilt]

Sarah: "I need time."

She returns three weeks later. Not because she forgave, but because she understands: he made impossible

choice. But trust never fully returns.

Current State: Fragile but deep relationship. Sarah is only person James allows to see vulnerability, but also

only person he fears hurting. She insists on doing engine maintenance (strange but genuine intimacy). They

don't live together‚ÄîJames fears literally burning her during nightmare.

Sarah's Quote: "You're not a monster, James. You're just... a very complicated machine with a very human

heart. Even if that heart is made of bronze and regret."

ARTHUR "WRENCH" DAVIES (The Antagonistic Brother Reimagined)

Profile:

34 years old (1956)

Silas's previous experiment (1948)

Twist: Arthur isn't cold from success‚Äîhe's cold because he failed

History: Arthur was Silas's first "engine-heart," four years before James. Engine worked... technically. But

burned his emotions so fast and completely that now he's emotionally inert. Feels no anger, fear, love, sadness

‚Äînothing. He's perfect machine and dead human.

Contrast with James:

James exaggerates emotions; Arthur has none

James fears becoming machine; Arthur already is machine

James still fights; Arthur accepted

Philosophical Conflict: Arthur sees James as "waste of potential." Believes emotions are defect, not resource.

Works as freelance assassin‚Äîefficient, cold, perfect. Wants to "help" James "evolve" by permanently removing

his emotions.

Defining Moment: First meeting (1955). Arthur finds James in alley after fight.

Arthur [monotone voice]: "You're wasting it. All that power, and you squander it on feelings."

James [motor revving]: "Feelings are the bloody point, mate!"

Arthur: "No. Feelings are the flaw. I was like you once. Angry. Scared. It hurt. Now..." [pause] "...nothing hurts.

Nothing matters. It's perfect."

James [horrified]: "That's not perfect. That's death."

Arthur [tilts head, genuinely confused]: "What's the difference?"

James realizes: he's looking at his own future if continues burning emotions recklessly.

Arthur as Mirror: Each encounter with Arthur forces James to confront: is he using engine to express

emotions or avoid them? Is he becoming freer or more dependent? Is he living or just burning?

THOMAS "TOMMY" BYRNE (The Boy)

Profile:

12 years old (1956)

Has identical congenital heart condition to what James had

Son of Hadley & Sons worker (same factory)

Symbolism: James before transformation

How They Met: Tommy saw James during public fight (1955). Was fascinated instead of scared. Started

following James, asking questions, wanting to understand engine. James tried to push him away. Tommy

persisted.

Dynamic: Tommy represents choice James never had. Boy idolizes James, sees engine as "solution" to his own

weakness. James is desperate to make Tommy understand: this isn't upgrade, it's curse.

Central Conflict: Silas eventually offers to transform Tommy (1957). Boy's parents, desperate, consider it.

James must decide: protect Tommy from becoming what he is, or recognize he'd deny boy the "life" James

himself has?

Crucial Dialogue:

Tommy: "You're so strong now! You can do anything!"

James [takes boy's hand, places on own chest]: "Feel that? 45 degrees. I'm burning meself alive just to stay

awake. Every day. Forever."

Tommy: "But you're alive. I'm... I'm dying, Mr. Revex. Doctors said I got maybe a year."

James [motor stalls for second, pure emotion]: "...I know, kid. I know."

Possible Resolution: James physically confronts Silas, destroying transformation equipment. Makes Silas

swear never to do this again. Tommy dies six months later, naturally, with James beside him. James doesn't burn

sadness from that loss‚Äîlets it burn him.

"It was the first time in years I felt pain without transforming it into fuel. Hurt like hell. Worth every second."

DETECTIVE INSPECTOR MARGARET THORNE (The Hunter)

Profile:

41 years old, Scotland Yard

Veteran investigating "anomalous industrial activity" in Birmingham

Lost husband in factory accident (1949)‚Äîblames negligent owners

Motivation: Justice, not revenge (but line is thin)

Relationship with James: Thorne KNOWS about James since 1953. Has complete file. But doesn't arrest him

because:

1. He technically hasn't committed crimes beyond fighting (self-defense)

2. Criminals he hurts usually deserve it

3. She suspects James is victim, not villain

Moral Conflict: Thorne sees James as symptom of bigger problem: dehumanizing industrialization, negligent

factory owners, mad war veterans conducting experiments. She wants Silas, not James. But James protects Silas

(gratitude/dependency complex).

Eventual Checkmate: Thorne offers deal (1958): help me arrest Silas, I guarantee you get proper medical

treatment, not prison. James must choose between toxic protector and possible cure.

Dialogue:

Thorne: "You know he's using you, don't you? You're not his son. You're his experiment."

James: "Maybe. But he's the only one who knows how to keep me alive."

Thorne: "Is that living, Mr. Revex? Really?"

James: [no answer]

üé≠ THEMES AND DEEP SYMBOLISM

Expanded Central Metaphors

Engine as Addiction: Not just replacement heart‚Äîit's drug. More James uses power, more he needs to use.

Redline produces chemical euphoria. He's literally addicted to his own rage/pain/power. Recovery would mean

accepting weakness again.

Birmingham as Womb/Tomb: City created him (working-class childhood), birthed him (factory accident), and

now keeps him trapped. James can't leave Birmingham‚Äîliterally and metaphorically. When he tries (1954),

engine begins failing (psychosomatic? Real?). City is prison and home simultaneously.

Fire as False Catharsis: Each flame is expressed emotion, but violent expression isn't processing. James

"releases" twenty years of silence... but never heals original trauma. He's just burning symptoms, not treating

disease.

Silence as Death/Peace: Central paradox: silence would kill James now (stopped engine = death), but silence

was life before. He destroyed only state where he could exist peacefully. Now peace = death.

Philosophical Conflicts

HUMANITY VS. MACHINERY: "If I replace heart with engine, am I still human? If my thoughts have RPM,

are they still my thoughts? If I must burn love to save it, is that still love?"

James lives on ontological frontier between person and tool. Some days believes he's human with engine. Other

days, engine with residual human memories.

CONTROL VS. SURRENDER: "Can I master engine or must I surrender to it? Is trying to control denying

my nature? Is surrendering abandoning humanity?"

Spectrum between two extremes:

Total Control: Never use power, live in idle = slow death by atrophy

Total Surrender: Live permanently in Redline = burn fast and bright

James oscillates painfully between both, never finding balance.

PAST VS. PRESENT VS. FUTURE:

Past (Silenced Boy): Forced quietness, clarity, simplicity, imminent death

Present (Demonized Engine): Power, chaos, noise, addiction, borrowed life

Future (?): Three equally terrifying possibilities:

1. Become Arthur (machine without emotions)

2. Engine fails permanently (return to fragility)

3. Burn completely (literal death in flames)

VICTIM VS. MONSTER: James was victim of disease, poverty, medical negligence, experiment without

consent. But also caused pain: burned people, destroyed property, used Sarah's love as fuel.

"Can you be both? Can trauma justify cruelty? Where's the line between survival and monstrosity?"

Answer: There's no line. There's spectrum. James slides daily.

Object Symbolism

The Drawing Notebook: Only object from previous life that survived. Contains drawings of impossible

machines James created at 15 years old‚Äîincluding, horrifyingly, something resembling his own current engine.

Did he draw his own transformation years before it happened? Or did Silas see drawings and use as inspiration?

James never asked. Fears answer.

Mother's Wedding Ring: James wears it on chain around neck. Survived explosion. Permanently heated to

45¬∞C‚Äînever cools. Constant reminder of last time he couldn't scream when it mattered.

Maintenance Tools: Sarah keeps them. Specific wrenches for engine valves. Strange intimacy: she's only

person who can "open him" literally. Maintenance act is more intimate than sex‚Äîrequires absolute trust (he's

vulnerable, partially sedated).

Mirror Fragments: James doesn't keep whole mirrors. Only fragments. Looking at complete reflection is

painful‚Äîseeing how much he's changed. Fragments let him focus on parts: eyes (still human), hands (still

recognizable), chest (alien).

üî• POSSIBLE NARRATIVE ARCS (REFINED)

ARC 1: "The Unwinding" (Deconstruction)

Premise: Engine begins failing progressively. James discovers he's burning muscle mass as supplemental fuel.

First time in years he feels genuine fear of death.

Three-Act Structure:

ACT I - Symptoms (1957):

James notices rapid weight loss

Stalls become more frequent

Sarah detects corrosion in main valves

Diagnosis: Engine consuming body tissue

Expectation: 6-12 months until catastrophic failure

ACT II - Search (1957-58):

James seeks Silas for repair

Discovers diary with truth about Robert

Emotional confrontation: "I was never your son. I was your do-over."

Silas reveals: all other engine-hearts died (Arthur is exception because emotionally dead = lower

consumption)

James is only survivor because burns emotions most intensely‚Äîthis devours him faster

ACT III - Choice (1958):

Silas offers "solution": completely remove emotions (Arthur's process)

Sarah offers alternative: shut down engine, live as cardiac invalid again

Tommy (already dead at this point) left letter: "Don't let them make you quiet again."

Final Decision: James refuses both

Instead, chooses to burn himself completely doing something that matters (destroy Hadley & Sons for

negligence that killed father, Tommy, others)

Engine explodes during final attack

Ambiguity: Does James die? Or survive with destroyed engine, returning to fragility but free?

Theme: "Sometimes the only way to win is to stop playing."

ARC 2: "The Kindling" (Redemption Through Purpose)

Premise: James discovers network of factories conducting similar experiments on desperate veterans. Decides

to stop this before others become what he is.

Three-Act Structure:

ACT I - Discovery (1956):

James encounters another engine-heart (not Arthur)

This one is newer, more unstable, suffering

Traces back to clandestine factory in Manchester

Discovers: Silas sold blueprints to wealthy industrialists

Six other engine-hearts being created

ACT II - Crusade (1956-57):

James becomes focused vigilante

Sarah helps track factories

Thorne turns blind eye (enemy of my enemy)

James saves two engine-hearts before transformation completes

But arrives late for others‚Äîwitnesses transformation, can't stop it

Turning Point: One engine-heart becomes like Arthur (cold, dead inside)

James must "euthanize" him‚Äîmoment of moral horror

ACT III - Confrontation (1957-58):

James confronts scheme leader: Industrial lord wanting to create "super-workers"

Discovery: Silas was being blackmailed (threatened to reveal illegal experiment)

James partially forgives Silas, but relationship never recovers

Destroys factories, frees surviving engine-hearts

Resolution: James creates "sanctuary"‚Äîplace where engine-hearts can live without judgment

Learns to control engine not by suppressing emotions, but channeling them toward purpose

Theme: "Trauma doesn't disappear. But it can be transformed into purpose."

ARC 3: "The Burning Man" (Descent Into Madness)

Premise: James progressively loses control, addicted to Redline. Becomes force of pure chaos. Tragic fall story.

Three-Act Structure:

ACT I - Addiction (1955-56):

After burning Sarah's love, something breaks in James

Begins using Redline recreationally (not just combat)

Sarah notices, tries to intervene, fails

James pushes everyone away, isolating himself

First signs of psychosis: conversations with engine as separate entity

ACT II - Spiral (1956-57):

James becomes mercenary, selling violence

More he uses power, more he needs to use

Engine begins "talking" (auditory hallucination)

Confuses real memories with industrial noises

Arthur tries to "recruit" James for assassination work

James accepts (lowest point)

ACT III - Immolation (1957):

Sarah makes final attempt to save him

James, during Redline, nearly kills her accidentally

Moment of clarity: sees reflection, doesn't recognize himself

Final Choice: Two possibilities:

TRAGIC: James surrenders completely, becomes natural force of destruction, must be stopped (by

Arthur, Thorne, or Sarah)

CATHARTIC: James uses last remnant of humanity to throw himself in Thames River, engine

explodes submerged, dies as human (conscious choice)

Theme: "Some fires can't be controlled. Only extinguished."

ARC 4: "The Quiet Revolution" (Transcendence)

Premise: James fully accepts hybrid nature, becomes something new‚Äîneither human nor machine, but

functional synthesis.

Three-Act Structure:

ACT I - Acceptance (1956):

After years fighting engine, James stops resisting

Begins meditating (ironic: mental quietness with engine roaring)

Sarah teaches emotional engineering techniques

James learns: doesn't need to suppress emotions or burn them recklessly

Discovery: Can recycle emotional fuel (feel, partially burn, process, feel again)

ACT II - Evolution (1956-57):

James develops fine engine control

Achieves idle at 600 RPM (new low record) without pain

Can modulate Redline in stages (not all-or-nothing)

Relationship with Sarah improves: physical intimacy becomes possible (with care)

Tommy sees James's evolution, chooses not to undergo transformation (James proves he can live

differently)

ACT III - Synthesis (1957-58):

James confronts Arthur, offers to help him reconnect with emotions

Arthur refuses, but moment plants seed of doubt

James reconciles with Silas: "You didn't save me or kill me. You changed me. I decide what that means."

Makes peace with engine: names it (Robert, honoring Silas's son he never knew)

Resolution: James finds balance‚Äîlives with engine, not despite it

Becomes mentor for other engine-hearts, teaching balance

Theme: "Healing isn't returning to who you were. It's becoming who you are."

üíé DEFINITIVE SCENE: THE CHARACTER TEST

"The Mirror in the River" (1957)

James stands on bridge over Thames River. 3 AM. Engine at low idle (1000 RPM). Sarah is behind him, silent.

James: "I come here sometimes. When the noise gets too loud inside."

Sarah: "The motor or your head?"

James: "Same thing now, innit? [pause] I saw a kid today. Maybe seven, eight years old. Playing by the docks.

Happy. Loud. Screaming with joy while running. And I thought... I used to envy that. The freedom to just... feel.

Now I got it and I... [motor revs involuntarily] I don't know if it's freedom or just a different cage."

Sarah moves beside him, not too close (respects the heat).

Sarah: "What do you see? When you look at the water?"

James looks at distorted reflection‚Äîsmoke, embers where eyes should be.

James: "A monster. A machine. Something that shouldn't exist."

Sarah: "I see a man who saves kids from burning buildings. Who could've let Tommy die to prove a point but

didn't. Who burns himself alive every day just to keep going." [pause] "That's not a machine, James. Machines

don't choose. You do."

James: "Do I? Or is it just the motor making me think I'm choosing?"

Silence. Engine coughs once. James laughs‚Äîgenuine sound, not hysterical.

James: "You know what the worst part is? I'm not even sure I want to go back. To being quiet. Weak. Dying in

inches. Even if I could..." [looks at own hands, lightly smoking] "...I think I like the fire. And that scares me

more than anything else."

Sarah takes his hand. Her skin immediately reddens, but she doesn't let go.

Sarah: "Then don't go back. Go forward. Be something new."

James looks at her, then at reflection again. For first time, doesn't see monster. Sees... possibility.

James [whispers]: "...okay."

Engine stabilizes. 1200 RPM. Steady. For first time in years, seems almost... peaceful.

üìù FINAL DEVELOPMENT NOTES

What Makes James Revex Unique

Not about power. It's about cost of power.

Not about trauma. It's about how trauma transforms into addiction when expressed violently.

Not about being monster or man. It's about living on frontier between both and choosing daily which to

feed.

Questions the Character Asks

1. How much of me can I burn before nothing remains?

2. Can being saved and being destroyed be the same thing?

3. If my cure is my curse, what is freedom?

4. Can I love something without eventually using it as fuel?

5. When did I stop being person and become tool?

Why 1952-1958?

Perfect Historical Context:

Post-war England: collective unprocessed trauma

Maximum industrialization, before automation

Era of "reconstruction" that ignores human cost

War veterans returning broken, society expecting them to "get over it"

Experimental medicine (recent antibiotics, bold surgeries)

Parallel: Entire nation has "engine in chest"‚Äîburning itself to rebuild, ignoring trauma

Character Legacy

James Revex is study of:

Addiction disguised as power

Trauma transformed into identity

Cure that hurts

Strength that consumes

Humanity at ontological frontiers

He doesn't have answers. Only increasingly better questions.

And perhaps that's enough.

"I burn, therefore I am."
