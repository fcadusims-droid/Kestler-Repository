FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES

The Paradox of Total Memory vs. Total Forgetting

The Problem: How can something be completely erased if executors maintain detailed records?

Resolution: The Cantus Oblivionis operates on two distinct planes of existence:

Physical existence: Completely erased. No buildings, objects, or structures remain on earth.

Memorial existence: Preserved only in the memories of the Lamens—a sacred order sworn to eternal

silence—and removed from all public and accessible spaces.

The ritual does not seek to make a nation literally disappear from history—this would be impossible and even

childish. It seeks to erase it from shared physical space and accessible memory, transforming it from a tangible

civilization into a ghost that exists only in the locked minds of those who can never speak of it.

Analogy: It is like burning someone's house while the only witness is bound by unbreakable oath never to

speak of what they saw. The house no longer exists for the world, and the only one who remembers cannot tell.

PHILOSOPHICAL AND SPIRITUAL FRAMEWORK

The Doctrine of Departed Souls

The people who practice Cantus Oblivionis hold a fundamental belief: when a being lives, the soul inhabits the

body and makes it sacred. At the moment of death, the soul departs instantly, leaving only flesh—empty matter

without any spiritual value.

Therefore:

Marching over bodies is not desecration, for there is nothing there to desecrate

The physical remains are merely discarded vessels

However, this creates a philosophical tension: if the body holds no value once the soul departs, why do

structures matter?

Resolution: While individuals lose their souls at death, collective works—buildings, monuments, cities—are

considered to hold cultural essence. These are not containers for individual souls, but rather the territorial

fingerprints of a civilization's collective spirit. When that civilization proves unworthy through dishonorable

war, these fingerprints must be erased.

The structures themselves become witnesses to dishonor. A palace where corrupt kings plotted unjust wars

carries the stain of those decisions. A monument celebrating false glory perpetuates the lie. A city that cheered

for dishonorable conquest becomes complicit in the crime.

The ritual targets not individual souls (which have already departed to whatever lies beyond) but the territorial

shadow a nation cast upon the earth—the physical evidence that they existed and acted dishonorably.

NATURE OF THE RITUAL

The Cantus Oblivionis is not merely a victory celebration, but a judgment executed through absolute

destruction. It is the most severe sentence that can be imposed on a kingdom or nation: the complete erasure of

its physical, cultural, and memorial existence from all accessible human knowledge.

This sacred ritual is only invoked when the enemy has violated the fundamental principles of honorable warfare

—those who attacked out of territorial greed, empty ambition, or motives deemed frivolous and unworthy of

bloodshed.

"Where your eyes gazed, we shall blind the earth. Where your feet trod, we shall tear the soil. Where your

voices echoed, we shall bring eternal silence. Every stone that warmed your backs, every tree that sheltered

your dreams, every wall that held your laughter—all shall be dust beneath our boots. We destroy not only

what you built—we destroy even the air you breathed. When we finish, the very wind will forget you once

stood here."

— Traditional inscription carved on memorial stones at march completion sites

CRITERIA FOR INVOCATION

The Cantus Oblivionis can only be declared when:

The enemy initiated hostilities without just cause or legitimate provocation

The war was motivated by pure territorial expansion without ancestral claim

The attack was made out of greed for resources without genuine need

There was deliberate betrayal of treaties or sacred pacts

Aggression was based on the whim of rulers or corrupt nobility

The war caused suffering disproportionate to any conceivable legitimate aim

The judgment process is neither quick nor superficial. It is as deep, full, and meticulous as possible.

The Secret Investigation (Inquisitio Occulta)

Timing: This investigation occurs during the war itself, running parallel to military operations. It begins

shortly after the first major engagement and continues throughout the conflict.

Before any formal deliberation occurs, specialized investigators are secretly sent into enemy territory. These are

not common military spies, but Inquisitores Oblivionis—agents trained in deep infiltration, cultural analysis,

and historical investigation.

Their mission:

Discover the true motives of the attack—was it unanimous leadership decision? Internal coup? Radical

faction? External manipulation?

Investigate whether there was internal dissent—citizens who opposed the war but were silenced

Document the chain of decisions leading to conflict—who proposed, who supported, who profited

Identify if legitimate hidden causes exist—perhaps the war seems frivolous but there was secret famine or

undeclared threat

Collect physical evidence: government documents, correspondence, financial records

Interview (discreetly) common citizens, deserter soldiers, government officials

Study the culture deeply—language, customs, art, philosophy, daily life

Typical duration: 6 months to 2 years, depending on nation size and political complexity.

Cases where investigation changed everything:

There are historical records of Inquisitors returning with discoveries that canceled planned Cantus Oblivionis:

War initiated by mad king, entire population was against it

Attack was desperate response to secret trade blockade (legitimate undeclared cause)

Internal coup d'état—the government that started the war had already fallen

In these cases, normal peace treaties are established, and Inquisitors present their findings to the council as

justification for mercy.

The moral weight:

This investigation separates Cantus Oblivionis from arbitrary genocide. It is recognition that even in war, truth

matters. The ritual is only just if based on verified facts, not convenient assumptions.

The Deliberative Council

After investigation and after military victory, a special war council convenes, composed of:

Military commanders who fought

Neutral sages and historians (often from third-party nations)

Representatives of families who lost members in the war

The Inquisitors themselves presenting evidence

Religious or philosophical authorities who can judge the moral weight

They deliberate for weeks, sometimes months. The decision must be unanimous. A single dissenting vote

cancels the Cantus Oblivionis.

The weight of unanimity:

This requirement is not ceremonial—it is the ritual's moral foundation. It acknowledges that such an extreme

judgment cannot rest on majority rule or executive decision alone. Every voice must agree, or the decision is

rejected.

If approved, the Edict of the Void is proclaimed and preparations for the ritual begin.

THE LAMENS: BEARERS OF THE LAST SONG

Origin and Nature

The Lamens (from Latin lamentum, "lament") are a sacred order of memory-keepers and culture-destroyers.

They are simultaneously scholars, warriors, and willing prisoners of the knowledge they can never share.

Selection:

Identified in childhood for exceptional eidetic memory and emotional resilience

Must demonstrate both empathy (to understand a culture deeply) and detachment (to witness its destruction

without breaking)

Volunteer status is absolute—no one is forced to become a Lamen

Undergo 10-15 years of rigorous training before first assignment

Training includes:

Accelerated learning techniques and memory palace construction

Linguistic mastery (ability to learn new languages in months)

Cultural anthropology and ethnographic methods

Mental fortitude exercises (meditation, pain tolerance, psychological conditioning)

Combat training (they must survive in hostile territory)

The philosophy of the Eternal Silence—preparing psychologically for a lifetime of sealed knowledge

The Sacred Vow

Upon completing training, Lamens take the Votum Silentii Aeternum (Vow of Eternal Silence):

"What I learn, I shall never teach. What I see, I shall never describe. What I hear, I shall never repeat. The

knowledge entrusted to me dies with me, and not even torture, love, or death's approach shall break this seal.

I am the tomb of memory, the grave of words, the last echo that shall never sound again."

Nature of the Vow:

The vow is not merely ceremonial. Depending on the civilization's capabilities, it may be enforced through:

1. Mystical Binding (Magical Settings):

The vow is sealed through ritual magic

Attempting to speak forbidden knowledge causes physical inability—throat closes, voice fails, words

become incomprehensible sounds

The magic does not erase memory, only prevents its transmission

2. Psychological Conditioning (Realistic/Sci-Fi Settings):

Years of Pavlovian conditioning create involuntary mental blocks

Attempting to speak triggers severe psychological distress (panic attacks, dissociation, overwhelming

anxiety)

The conditioning is so deep that breaking the vow becomes physically impossible for most

3. Hostage Protocol (Any Setting):

When a Lamen takes the vow, a beloved family member (usually a child or spouse) is placed in

"protective custody"

They are not harmed or imprisoned—they live comfortable lives

But their freedom is conditional on the Lamen's silence

If the vow is broken, the hostage is executed

This burden ensures the Lamen carries not only knowledge but responsibility for another's life

4. Combined Enforcement:

Most implementations use multiple methods simultaneously

The redundancy ensures absolute security

The Lamens' burden:

Unlike magical memory erasure, the Lamens remember everything forever. They carry encyclopedic

knowledge of dead civilizations but can never share a single word. They become living tombs of culture—

museums that can never be visited, books that can never be read.

Many Lamens report that the weight of unspoken knowledge becomes physically painful over decades. Some

develop elaborate coping mechanisms—writing in invented languages that they immediately burn, creating art

that hints at but never reveals, or simply withdrawing into silence about all things.

The Lamens' Work During Cantus Oblivionis

Phase 1: Deep Study (6 months to 2 years)

While the Inquisitores Oblivionis investigate political and military matters, the Lamens are deployed to study

the culture itself:

Live among the enemy population (disguised as merchants, refugees, wanderers)

Learn the language to native fluency

Study literature, poetry, songs, folklore

Document architectural styles and artistic traditions

Record recipes, crafts, daily customs

Attend religious ceremonies, festivals, celebrations

Interview elders about history and traditions

Memorize everything—the Lamens take no written notes that could be captured

They fall in love with what they will destroy. This is not accidental—it is necessary. Only by truly

understanding and even admiring a culture can they create an authentic elegy for it.

Phase 2: Composition of the Last Song (2-6 months)

After military victory, the Lamens gather in complete isolation to compose the Cantus Ultimus (Last Song):

The song is created in three versions simultaneously:

Version 1: The Scholar's Song (Secret/Never Sung)

Complete encyclopedic record in the enemy's own language

Contains specific cultural details, historical events, philosophical concepts

Functions as oral backup of everything learned

Exists only in the memories of the Lamens

Never performed publicly

Version 2: The Marcher's Song (Public/Ritual)

Simplified, propagandistic version in the executor's language

Focuses on the enemy's crimes and dishonor

Uses distorted melodies from enemy culture (recognizable but corrupted)

Short enough to be memorized by soldiers and civilians

This is the song sung during the march

Version 3: The Echo's Song (Fragmented/Carried by Refugees)

Fragments of Version 2 that refugees overhear

Deliberately incomplete and traumatic

Designed to spread through survivor testimony

Creates terror without revealing the full truth

Musical structure of the Marcher's Song:

Uses traditional instruments from the destroyed culture (captured during war)

Employs their musical modes and scales but in twisted, melancholic forms

Four-part structure:

Part 1 (Glory): Briefly acknowledges what the nation once was

Part 2 (Fall): Describes the moment they chose dishonor

Part 3 (Crimes): Lists specific atrocities during the war

Part 4 (Judgment): Declares their erasure from existence

Constant refrain: The nation's name followed by "and now you are only memory in us, your last echo, your

last breath"

Phase 3: The March of Erasure (weeks to years)

During the entire march through enemy territory, the Lamens lead the singing:

They form the vanguard and rearguard of the marching formation

Their voices rise first at dawn and last at dusk

They teach the Marcher's Song to soldiers and civilians who join

Different groups sing different parts in harmony

The song echoes continuously through the devastation

Witnesses report the psychological effect is devastating:

The music is simultaneously beautiful and horrifying

Uses the victim culture's own artistic traditions against itself

Creates cognitive dissonance—why does our own music condemn us?

Refugees who escape carry the tune in nightmares for the rest of their lives

Phase 4: The Return to Silence (After march completion)

When the march ends and the last structure falls, the Lamens perform their final duty:

They gather in a sealed chamber away from all observers

They sing the Scholar's Song (complete version) one final time—for each other, for the culture, for memory

itself

This is their private farewell to the knowledge they can never share

Then they disperse, returning to their isolated monasteries or homes

They never speak of what they learned

They carry the burden until death

The Lamens' fate:

Most Lamens participate in only one or two Cantus Oblivionis in their lifetime—the psychological weight is too

great for more. Many withdraw completely from society, becoming hermits or monks. Some go mad from the

burden of unspoken knowledge. A few become poets or artists, creating works in coded metaphor that hint at

but never reveal what they know.

When a Lamen dies, there is a ceremony where their body is cremated and the ashes scattered in the ocean. The

eulogy is always the same:

"Here passes one who knew what none shall know, who saw what none shall see, who carried what none

shall carry again. The tomb is opened and the tomb is empty. The silence is complete."

THE EDICT OF CONTAGION

The Global Declaration

Immediately after the Edict of the Void is proclaimed (declaring Cantus Oblivionis), a second decree is issued to

all known nations, kingdoms, colonies, and sovereign entities. This is the Edictum Contagii (Edict of

Contagion):

"By the power invested in us by the laws of honorable war, the nation of [Name] is declared a stain upon the

earth. Their physical existence and cultural memory shall be erased absolutely.

Let it be known to all sovereigns and peoples: Any nation, territory, or entity that offers permanent refuge,

citizenship, or platform for cultural preservation to the exiles of [Name] shall be deemed complicit in the

original dishonor.

Such an act shall be interpreted as an attempt to resurrect the corpse of a condemned idea and shall subject

the offending nation to the same judgment. Their land, their people, their memory—all shall face the Cantus

Oblivionis.

Do not shelter their ghosts, for you shall become one.

Temporary humanitarian passage through your territories is not forbidden. But integration, citizenship, or

the preservation of their cultural identity within your borders shall be considered an act of war against the

justice we have declared.

We do not ask for your approval. We inform you of the consequences."

The Psychology of the Edict

Why it works despite executors being potentially weaker:

The Edict of Contagion is not enforced through military superiority—it is enforced through strategic terror

and rational fear.

Consider the decision calculus for any nation:

Benefit of sheltering refugees:

Humanitarian satisfaction

Potential labor force

Minor diplomatic goodwill from other compassionate nations

Total value: Minimal

Risk of sheltering refugees:

Potential complete annihilation via Cantus Oblivionis

Total cost: Infinite (national extinction)

Rational choice under uncertainty:

Even if a nation believes there is only a 1% chance the executors could actually carry out Cantus Oblivionis

against them, the expected value calculation is:

99% chance × (small benefit) + 1% chance × (total annihilation) = Never worth it

The power of demonstrated capability:

The fact that the executors have successfully completed one Cantus Oblivionis proves:

1. They have the will to carry it through

2. They have the organizational capacity

3. They have the ideological commitment

4. They have the patience (it takes years)

Even if they are militarily weaker now, other nations think:

"What if they have allies we don't know about?"

"What if they're willing to sacrifice everything for this?"

"What if we're wrong about their strength?"

"Even if we win militarily, is the risk worth a few refugees?"

Historical parallel:

This is exactly how nuclear deterrence worked during the Cold War:

Neither side knew the other's full capabilities

Neither side could be certain of winning

The mere possibility of mutual assured destruction prevented direct conflict

Bluffs worked because the cost of being wrong was too high

The Edict exploits existential risk aversion:

Humans (and rational decision-makers) are naturally risk-averse when facing existential threats. A nation might

risk war for territory or resources, but risking complete cultural annihilation for the sake of refugees is

irrational.

Enforcement: Distributed and Self-Perpetuating

The brilliance of the Edict is that the executors don't need to enforce it—other nations enforce it on

themselves and each other.

Mechanisms of distributed enforcement:

1. Border Closures:

Nations immediately close borders to refugees from the condemned nation

Not out of cruelty, but out of self-preservation

2. Mutual Surveillance:

Nations watch each other nervously

If Nation A suspects Nation B is sheltering refugees, Nation A reports it

Why? Because if Nation B becomes target of Cantus Oblivionis, the instability could affect everyone

3. Active Hunting:

Independent mercenaries and bounty hunters hunt refugees

Motivation: Some nations offer rewards for proof that refugees were captured/expelled

Also: Refugees become convenient scapegoats—blame them for any local problems

4. Social Contagion of Fear:

Even individuals who want to help refugees fear social punishment

"You're hiding one of THEM? Are you trying to get us all killed?"

Refugee-helpers become pariahs themselves

5. Preemptive Compliance:

Nations compete to demonstrate loyalty by being extra harsh on refugees

"Look, we killed any refugee we found—please don't think we're sheltering them!"

Cruelty becomes signal of non-complicity

The Edict creates a self-reinforcing terror system:

Fear → Border closures → Refugees have nowhere to go →
Fear → Border closures → Refugees have nowhere to go →

They become visible/desperate → Easy to hunt →
They become visible/desperate → Easy to hunt →

Hunting proves nations' loyalty → Fear is validated →
Hunting proves nations' loyalty → Fear is validated →

Public Distribution of Refugee Identity

As part of the Edict of Contagion, the executors release detailed information about refugees:

Information distributed to all nations:

Names of prominent citizens who fled

Physical descriptions

Family lineages

Last known locations

Sketches or (in advanced settings) photographs

Distinguishing marks, accents, linguistic patterns

Cultural practices that might identify them

Purpose:

Make it impossible for refugees to hide in plain sight

Turn every citizen of every nation into potential informant

Create paranoia among refugees (anyone could recognize and report them)

Modern/Futuristic implementation:

In technologically advanced settings, biometric data is shared

Facial recognition systems are programmed to flag refugees

DNA markers (if setting allows) are distributed

Border control systems automatically reject them

Bounty hunter networks receive real-time updates

The cruelty:

Refugees cannot even reinvent themselves. They cannot adopt new names, new identities, new lives. They are

permanently marked.

STRUCTURE OF THE RITUAL

Phase 1: The Declaration (Post-Victory)

Immediately after decisive military victory, commanders gather at the final battlefield. At this location, a herald

proclaims the Edict of the Void, formally declaring that the enemy will be subjected to Cantus Oblivionis.

The proclamation is delivered in three languages:

1. The executor's language (for their own people)

2. The defeated nation's language (for any survivors)

3. A neutral lingua franca (for international observers)

This declaration is sent to:

All conquered cities and villages of the defeated nation

All neighboring nations

All major powers and international bodies

Religious authorities and neutral observers

A grace period of 30 days is granted:

Any civilian who wishes to flee may do so

No military pursuit during this exodus

However, the Edict of Contagion is already in effect—refugees have nowhere to go

Psychological purpose of the grace period:

It is not mercy—it is strategic:

1. Allows time for the Edict of Contagion to spread globally

2. Gives refugees false hope, making their subsequent rejection more traumatic

3. Demonstrates to international observers that the executors "gave them a chance"

4. Allows time for Lamens to complete the Last Song composition

Phase 2: The Silent Return

After the 30-day grace period, the victorious army, accompanied by civilian volunteers, returns to the exact

point where the war began—whether a violated border, an attacked city, or the location of the first battle.

Who participates:

Mandatory:

All soldiers who fought in the war

All Lamens assigned to the operation

Military commanders and leadership

Voluntary:

Civilians who lost loved ones in the war

Artisans and demolition experts

Anyone who wishes to witness justice

Forbidden:

Children under 15 years

Those physically unable to march

Prisoners of war (they are held separately and released after the ritual)

This return journey is made in total silence:

No word is spoken

Only the sound of marching feet

It is contemplation before destruction

Soldiers meditate on what they are about to do

Duration: Usually 1-3 weeks depending on distance

Psychological purpose:

The silence serves multiple functions:

Forces participants to confront the weight of the coming destruction

Creates eerie, solemn atmosphere

Allows soldiers to process the transition from warriors to executors

The contrast with the coming song makes the sound more powerful

Phase 3: The March of Erasure

From the initial point of the war, the army and people begin to march through the entire war route, retracing

each step of the military campaign.

This time, the purpose is singular: absolute destruction.

Order of destruction (systematic and methodical):

1. Government and administrative buildings

Palaces, courthouses, government offices

Tax records, land deeds, official documents (copied by Lamens first)

Symbols of state authority

2. Military infrastructure

Fortresses, barracks, armories

Defensive walls (demolished stone by stone)

Training grounds

3. Cultural and religious sites

Temples, churches, sacred groves

Monuments and statues (sledgehammered to rubble)

Museums and art galleries (works cataloged, then destroyed)

Theaters and performance halls

4. Educational institutions

Schools, universities, libraries

Books are collected by Lamens' assistants, then burned

Scientific instruments destroyed

5. Economic infrastructure

Markets, warehouses, trade posts

Bridges, roads, ports

Mills, workshops, factories

6. Residential areas

Noble estates and common homes alike

Every house, every hut, every dwelling

Personal belongings burned

Family shrines demolished

7. Agricultural and natural

Cultivated fields burned

Irrigation systems destroyed

Planted orchards cut down

Domesticated animals released or slaughtered

Even symbolic trees (meeting places, wedding trees) are felled

What cannot be completely erased (natural limitations acknowledged):

Deep underground foundations

Geological traces and soil composition changes

Buried ceramic fragments and oxidized metals in subsoil

Vegetation changes (disturbed earth grows differently)

Buried human bones in deep graves

Caves and deep underground chambers if undiscovered

The executors are pragmatic:

They know perfect erasure is impossible. The goal is to destroy every human-touched space, every place that

carried cultural meaning. Archaeological fragments may survive, but without context, they tell no story.

Regarding bodies on battlefields:

As the march passes former battle sites:

Bodies are trampled without ceremony

Not from disrespect to souls (which have departed)

But from indifference to empty flesh

Some are burned afterward, others left to decompose naturally

Mass graves are not marked

Regarding survivors encountered:

Occasionally, the march encounters:

Those too old or sick to flee

Those who refused to leave ancestral homes

Traumatized individuals in shock

They are not killed—that would be murder, not territorial judgment. Instead:

They are given rations and directed toward borders

Forcibly evacuated if they refuse

If they violently resist and attack, defenders may use necessary force

But no systematic execution of civilians occurs

The ritual judges the land and culture, not individual souls.

Phase 4: The Song

From the first step of the March of Erasure until the last structure falls, the Lamens lead the singing of

the Last Song.

Daily structure:

Dawn (First Light):

The Lamens' voices rise first, beginning Part 1 (Glory)

Soldiers gradually join

The song starts soft, almost mournful

Morning to Midday:

Full voice, all participants singing

Harmonies weave through the marching columns

Different groups sing different parts

Afternoon:

As structures are demolished, Part 3 (Crimes) is emphasized

The song becomes accusatory, harsh

Tempo increases during destruction

Dusk:

Part 4 (Judgment) dominates

Refrain repeated continuously

Song fades as darkness falls

Night:

Silence returns

Campfires burn

Participants rest

The next day, the cycle repeats

Psychological impact on participants:

The song becomes automatic, hypnotic

Many report entering trance-like states

The repetition numbs emotional resistance

By week two, soldiers sing without conscious thought

It becomes a form of shared meditation

Psychological impact on remaining refugees:

Those who stayed or couldn't flee report:

Hearing the song from miles away

The sound echoing through valleys

Nightmares of the melody

Some go mad from the constant auditory assault

Others describe it as "the earth itself singing our death"

Phase 5: The Naked Land

When the march completes its circuit—having traversed the entire war territory—the landscape is transformed:

What remains:

Bare earth where cities stood

Exposed foundations and rubble

Ash fields where forests burned

Broken stone from demolished walls

Scattered, unidentifiable debris

Silence

What is gone:

Every intact structure

Every complete object

Every document and book

Every artwork and monument

Every cultivated plant

Every marker of human habitation

The land enters a state of sacred abandonment.

Phase 6: The Period of Natural Regeneration (Tempus Renascentia)

After Cantus Oblivionis, the devastated land is legally and ritually forbidden to human habitation.

Duration calculation:

Immediately after march completion, teams of naturalists, ecologists, and earth specialists are sent to assess:

Soil composition and damage

Presence of dormant seeds

Proximity of forests/wild vegetation that can naturally spread

Climate patterns and rainfall

Wildlife that can recolonize

Water sources and their condition

Based on scientific assessment, they calculate how long nature needs to completely reconquer the land—

transforming it from devastated territory to wild, untouched ecosystem.

Realistic timeframes (adjusted for plausibility):

Fertile temperate lands: 15-30 years

Temperate forests: 30-50 years

Arid or mountainous regions: 50-75 years

Severely damaged/salted lands: 75-100 years maximum

Why shorter periods matter:

Keeps the ritual politically relevant (same generation sees results)

Maintains deterrent effect (nations remember the punishment)

Allows executors to benefit from land sales/colonization

Prevents the ritual from becoming ancient forgotten legend

Legal status during Tempus Renascentia:

Borders are marked with stone cairns

Warning signs posted (in advanced settings: fences, monitoring)

Not heavily patrolled—reliance on superstition and respect

Trespassers are expelled, not executed

Religious belief often makes people avoid the area naturally

Occasional violations:

Hermits sometimes occupy remote areas

Treasure hunters search for buried valuables

Refugees in desperation hide in ruins

All are generally left alone unless they attempt to rebuild or farm

Phase 7: The Reborn Land and Its Destiny

When Tempus Renascentia ends, naturalists return to verify the land is completely regenerated:

Dense vegetation coverage

Wildlife population restored

Water sources clean

No visible traces of civilization above ground

The land is "virgin" again

The executor nation's leadership then decides the final fate:

Option 1: Sale to Allied or Neighboring Nations

The regenerated lands become valuable commodity:

Why nations buy:

Overpopulation pressures

Agricultural expansion needs

Strategic territorial positioning

"Clean slate" with no previous ownership disputes

No resentful local population to manage

Pricing:

Often very high—virgin lands are rare

No legal complications or historical claims

Seen as "blessed" or "purified" in some cultures

Sales process:

Auction or private negotiation

Buyer receives full sovereignty

No conditions attached (buyer can do anything with the land)

Revenue use:

Compensation to families who lost members in the original war

Funding for veterans

National infrastructure projects

Sometimes: funding for future Cantus Oblivionis preparations (maintaining Lamen monasteries, etc.)

Option 2: Free Colonization

The leader decrees the land is free for anyone to settle:

Who comes:

Landless peasants from multiple nations

Refugees from other wars

Religious or ideological communities seeking autonomy

Adventurers and pioneers

Criminals seeking fresh starts (though this can be restricted)

Advantages:

Generates international goodwill

Creates buffer territory with mixed population

No immediate cost to maintain

Reputation as magnanimous victor

Disadvantages:

No immediate economic benefit

Potential lawlessness if not managed

Mixed population may have conflicting interests

Option 3: Permanent Natural Reserve

In rare cases, the land is declared forever wild:

Reasons for this choice:

The Cantus Oblivionis was particularly controversial or traumatic

Religious or spiritual significance develops around the site

Strategic value as buffer zone between powers

Environmental/ecological preservation goals

Memorial purpose—"Let it remain as testament to what happened"

Management:

Usually designated as protected wilderness

Hunting may or may not be allowed

Scientific study permitted

No permanent habitation

Option 4: Executor Nation Keeps the Land

Sometimes the executors absorb the territory:

If it's strategically valuable

If they have population pressure

If they want direct control

However, this is culturally controversial within executor societies. Many believe that claiming the land

contradicts the ritual's purpose—it suggests the war was about conquest after all, not justice.

THE REFUGEE CRISIS: TWO CATEGORIES OF EXILE

The Edict of Contagion creates two distinct groups of refugees with radically different fates.

Category A: The Traumatized (Those Who Witnessed)

Who they are:

Refugees who stayed through most or all of the March of Erasure

Those who fled late, after witnessing significant destruction

Survivors of the final days who saw their entire world erased

Mental state:

Severe PTSD from witnessing systematic destruction of everything familiar

Many develop dissociative disorders, psychosis, or complete mental breakdown

Memories are fragmented, contradictory, surreal

Some become catatonic, others violently unstable

A significant percentage experience complete psychological collapse

The cruel paradox:

They carry the most complete testimony of what happened, but their trauma makes them the least credible

witnesses.

When they try to tell their story:

Traumatized Refugee: "They destroyed EVERYTHING. Every house, every tree, every stone. They sang while

they did it, for months, the same song over and over. They marched over the bodies. The whole world ended..."

Listener: "That's impossible. No one would do that. You're traumatized, confused, your mind is playing tricks.

You need rest, not an audience for these fantasies."

Why they're not believed:

1. Psychological presentation: Shaking, crying, dissociated affect makes them seem unstable

2. Narrative incoherence: PTSD fragments memory—they can't tell a linear story

3. Lack of corroboration: No physical evidence remains

4. Conflicting accounts: Different refugees remember different details, creating apparent contradictions

5. Motivated disbelief: Other nations WANT to disbelieve, because believing means confronting their own

complicity in abandoning them

Their fate:

Wander as homeless outcasts in frontier regions

Many die of exposure, starvation, or violence

Some form small, hidden communities of the traumatized

Their children grow up among the mad, inheriting trauma without understanding

Within two generations, their testimonies become garbled folk tales

Cultural self-erasure through trauma:

The survivors stop trying to preserve their culture because:

Remembering is too painful

Their children associate the old culture with parents' madness

No one believes them anyway—why maintain traditions that mark them as liars?

Survival requires hiding their origin, which means suppressing cultural markers

Category B: The Hunted (Those Who Fled Early)

Who they are:

People who fled during the initial war

Those who escaped during the 30-day grace period before the march

Individuals who were abroad when the ritual was declared

Those with the means, foresight, or luck to leave before witnessing the worst

Mental state:

Largely intact psychologically

Traumatized by loss, but not broken

Can articulate their experiences coherently

Maintain their cultural identity and memory

The cruel paradox:

They would be credible witnesses, but they are actively hunted and cannot speak publicly.

Why they're hunted:

1. The Edict of Contagion makes them toxic—any nation harboring them risks Cantus Oblivionis

2. Public identification: Their names, faces, and descriptions are distributed internationally

3. Bounty system: Some nations offer rewards for capturing/expelling them

4. Political signaling: Nations demonstrate loyalty to the executors by hunting refugees

5. Scapegoating: Refugees become convenient targets for any local problems

Their fate:

Constant flight:

Must keep moving, never settling

Change names and appearances

Hide in remote, uninhabited regions

Live in constant fear of recognition

Geographic dispersal:

Scattered across multiple continents/planets

No ability to form communities (too visible)

Isolated individuals or tiny family groups

Cultural erosion through necessity:

Stop speaking their native language (too identifying)

Abandon traditional clothing and customs

Don't teach their children about their heritage (to protect them)

Pretend to be from other nations

The second generation:

Children of Category B refugees often don't even know their true origin:

Parents lie about their ancestry to protect them

Raised in adoptive cultures

May sense something is hidden but never learn what

The truth dies with their parents

Occasional martyrs:

Rarely, a Category B refugee tries to tell their story publicly:

They are immediately reported

Local authorities kill or expel them to avoid Edict of Contagion consequences

Their testimony is dismissed as propaganda or madness

They become cautionary tales that silence other refugees

The Final Irony

Category A (traumatized):

Can speak but won't be believed

Carry truth but cannot communicate it effectively

Free to wander but psychologically imprisoned

Category B (hunted):

Would be believed but cannot speak

Possess coherent testimony but must hide

Mentally free but physically hunted

Together, they ensure complete erasure:

Neither category can effectively preserve or transmit their culture

The mad cannot be trusted

The sane cannot be found

Within three generations, the culture exists only in:

Confused fragments from Category A's mad descendants

Complete silence from Category B's assimilated descendants

The sealed memories of the Lamens who can never speak

DURATION AND LOGISTICS

Realistic Timeframes

Small territorial conflicts:

Investigation: 6-12 months

War duration: Weeks to months

March of Erasure: 2-8 weeks

Total ritual time: 3-6 months after war begins

Medium-scale wars:

Investigation: 1-2 years

War duration: Months to a year

March of Erasure: 2-6 months

Total ritual time: 1.5-3 years

Large empires:

Investigation: 2-3 years

War duration: 1-3 years

March of Erasure: 6 months to 2 years (with rotating participants)

Total ritual time: 3-8 years

Participant Rotation for Extended Operations

For marches lasting over six months:

Wave system:

Initial wave: Core military units and dedicated volunteers (mandatory minimum service: 3 months)

Subsequent waves: Rotating regional contingents (serve 1-3 months each)

Lamens: Present for the entire duration

Specialists (demolition, archivists): Serve as long as needed

Logistics:

Supply lines maintained from executor nation

Field camps established along the route

Agricultural lands in rear areas provide food

Rotating participants prevent exhaustion and desertion

POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES AND DETERRENCE

The Deterrent Effect: Power Through Uncertainty

Nations that know of Cantus Oblivionis react with:

Immediate terror:

No rational leader risks such a fate for their nation

Frivolous wars become unthinkable

Even legitimate grievances are reconsidered

The psychology of deterrence:

The executors may not be the strongest military power, but the Cantus Oblivionis makes them too dangerous to

provoke frivolously.

Why it works despite potential military weakness:

1. Demonstrated capability: Having completed it once proves they CAN do it

2. Demonstrated will: The years-long commitment proves they WILL do it

3. Asymmetric cost: Even if the executors could be defeated militarily, the cost of triggering Cantus

Oblivionis is total annihilation

4. Uncertainty amplification: Other nations don't know:

How many allies the executors have

What hidden resources they possess

How much they're willing to sacrifice

Whether they have other capabilities not yet revealed

Risk calculation for potential aggressors:

Even assuming only 5% chance the executors could successfully carry out Cantus Oblivionis against us:

95% chance: We win the war, gain territory = Benefit X

5% chance: Cantus Oblivionis, total extinction = Cost ∞

Expected value: Negative infinity

No rational actor accepts those odds.

Comparison to nuclear deterrence:

Like Cold War nuclear strategy, Cantus Oblivionis works through:

Mutual knowledge of consequences

Credible demonstration of capability

Asymmetric destruction potential

Making war "unwinnable" even for the stronger party

Temporal Decline of Deterrence

The deterrent effect naturally weakens over time:

0-50 years after execution:

Living witnesses exist

Memory is fresh and traumatic

Deterrence: Maximum

No nation dares test it

50-150 years after:

Original witnesses dead

Stories passed through generations

Details questioned: "Was it really that complete?"

Deterrence: Strong but weakening

Minor border skirmishes might occur, but no full invasion

150-300 years after:

Enters realm of legend

Scholars debate historical accuracy

Without physical ruins, skeptics emerge

Deterrence: Moderate

Nations still cautious but less terrified

300+ years after:

Becomes mythological

"They say the ancients had a ritual that could erase nations..."

Many don't believe it literally

Deterrence: Weak

Treated as cautionary myth rather than real threat

500+ years after:

Completely mythological

Disconnected from historical reality

Deterrence: Minimal

Only cultural taboo remains

Renewal of deterrence:

If a second Cantus Oblivionis is executed within 200-300 years of the first:

Validates the myth as reality

Resets the deterrence cycle to maximum

Creates multi-generational terror: "It happened AGAIN"

The pattern suggests it's not ancient history but living practice

CASES WHERE CANTUS OBLIVIONIS IS NOT APPLIED

The ritual is never executed when:

Legitimate casus belli existed:

Enemy had just cause for war (even if they lost)

Defensive war or legitimate territorial dispute

Response to genuine threat or provocation

Honorable conduct despite defeat:

Enemy fought honorably according to war customs

Surrendered with dignity and accepted terms

Protected civilians and prisoners of war

Respected sacred sites and non-combatants

Mitigating circumstances discovered:

Inquisitio Occulta reveals the war was not the nation's choice

Evidence of coercion, manipulation, or internal coup

Widespread internal dissent against the war

Leadership acted against the will of the people

Ambiguous moral judgment:

Council cannot reach unanimous decision

Significant doubt about whether criteria are met

Evidence is contradictory or incomplete

Enemy already punished sufficiently:

Military defeat was devastating enough

Leadership was overthrown by their own people

Internal collapse has already occurred

In these cases:

Conventional peace treaties are negotiated

War reparations may be required

Territory may be ceded

But the nation continues to exist

Their culture and memory are preserved

Dead on both sides are honored appropriately

ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECONSTRUCTION: THE MYSTERY FOR FUTURE
GENERATIONS

What Future Archaeologists Will Find

Centuries after a Cantus Oblivionis, archaeological excavations may uncover:

Physical evidence:

Building foundations without above-ground structures

Ceramic fragments systematically broken (not by natural erosion)

Ash layers indicating massive simultaneous burning

Metal objects corroded in unnatural patterns

Human remains in mass graves without markers

Soil composition changes indicating former agriculture

Stone rubble from demolished structures

Evidence of systematic, purposeful destruction

What they cannot reconstruct:

Without access to the Lamens' sealed memories or lost archives:

The specific culture and language

Their literature, philosophy, and arts

Social structures and daily life

Why they were destroyed

Whether the destruction was justified

Their own account of events

Their name for themselves

The archaeological puzzle:

Future scholars will debate:

"Was this a natural catastrophe?"

"Evidence suggests intentional destruction—but why so thorough?"

"Who were these people?"

"What did they do to deserve this?"

"Or were they victims of genocide?"

Theories that emerge:

1. Ritual purification: "Perhaps disease required complete abandonment"

2. Religious sacrifice: "Maybe the entire city was offered to gods"

3. Conquered and erased: "A warning to others by some empire"

4. Natural disaster misattributed: "Later legends invented the destruction narrative"

5. Civil war and mutual destruction: "They destroyed themselves"

None will know the truth unless:

They find a Lamen's sealed testimony (never happens—Lamens don't write)

They discover hidden archives (possible but extremely rare)

They encounter descendants of refugees (but refugee testimony is fragmented and not believed)

This archaeological ambiguity is not failure—it is success.

The civilization becomes an eternal question mark, a mystery that can never be solved. This is more powerful

than documented destruction, because it removes even the possibility of historical justice or clear moral

judgment.

MORAL REFLECTION

The Impossible Question

Cantus Oblivionis represents the belief that some actions in war are so dishonorable they deserve not merely

defeat, but obliteration of memory itself.

It is simultaneously:

A legal proceeding with investigation and unanimous deliberation

A military operation of systematic destruction

A spiritual ritual of territorial purification

A political strategy of deterrence through existential terror

A philosophical meditation on memory, justice, and existence

The central paradox:

To erase something completely, you must first know it completely.

The Inquisitors must investigate deeply

The Lamens must learn intimately

The executors must understand thoroughly

The ritual's true nature:

Cantus Oblivionis does not actually erase—nothing can. What it accomplishes is transformation:

From living civilization → controlled memory

From shared history → sealed secret

From public existence → private knowledge

From documented past → unresolvable mystery

The deepest achievement:

The destroyed nation exists only in conditional forms:

In the nightmares of traumatized refugees (not believed)

In the hunted silence of sane refugees (cannot speak)

In the sealed memories of Lamens (sworn to eternal silence)

In the confused fragments of archaeology (without context)

In the warning myths of other nations (doubted or dismissed)

The ritual grants the executors godlike power:

The power to control not just the present, but the past itself—to decide what can be remembered and how.

The Unanswerable Question

Every Cantus Oblivionis must confront one question:

Did they truly deserve this?

The Inquisitio Occulta exists to ensure the answer is "yes."

The unanimous council exists to ensure the judgment is just.

The careful criteria exist to prevent arbitrary application.

But history, robbed of neutral witnesses and complete records, can never judge fairly.

And perhaps that uncertainty—that permanent moral ambiguity—is the ritual's most terrifying aspect. It creates

situations where justice becomes unknowable, where even asking whether something was right or wrong

becomes impossible because the evidence needed to judge has been deliberately destroyed.

The Cost to the Executors

The ritual demands tremendous sacrifice from those who carry it out:

The Lamens:

Carry knowledge they can never share

Live with the psychological burden of sealed memories

Many die in isolation, haunted by what they know

Their sacrifice is total and invisible

The soldiers and civilians:

Spend months or years in systematic destruction

Witness and participate in erasure of an entire culture

Return changed, having seen the limits of human judgment

Some are haunted by doubt: "Were we just?"

The nation itself:

Bears the moral weight of erasure

Risks becoming what they punished

Creates precedent that may someday be used against them

The deterrent they created can cut both ways

The philosophical burden:

Once you have demonstrated the capacity and will to erase a civilization completely, other nations will always

wonder: "Could they do it to us? Would they?"

This creates isolation—respect mixed with terror, but never true trust.

CONCLUSION

The Cantus Oblivionis is not genocide—it is memoricide.

It kills not primarily people (who may flee), but the territorial and memorial existence of a nation judged

unworthy. It is the most extreme form of punishment imaginable: you did not deserve to have existed.

What makes it coherent:

Exhaustive investigation before judgment

Unanimous deliberation

Allowing refugees to flee (then making their flight meaningless)

The Lamens' sacrifice ensures knowledge is preserved but inaccessible

The Edict of Contagion creates self-enforcing global complicity

Psychological trauma ensures refugees cannot preserve culture even if they survive

What makes it terrifying:

It works through rational fear, not brute strength

It turns every nation into an enforcer

It creates two categories of refugees, both unable to preserve their culture

It ensures the destroyed civilization can never be fairly understood by history

It transforms the past itself into a controlled commodity

What makes it realistic:

Acknowledges that perfect erasure is impossible

Uses psychological warfare and distributed enforcement

Based on real historical precedents (nuclear deterrence, psychological trauma, refugee crises)

Accounts for natural limitations and human psychology

The final truth:

Cantus Oblivionis does not make nations disappear. It makes them ghosts that only certain people can see—

and those people either cannot speak, will not be believed, or are hunted into silence.

In this conditional existence—neither fully erased nor fairly preserved—the ritual achieves its ultimate goal:

control over the past itself.

Whether such power represents justice or the ultimate atrocity remains unanswerable—which is exactly what

the executors intend.

The destroyed nation loses sovereignty over its own story. And that loss of narrative control, more than any

physical destruction, is the true extinction.

"We march over your stones. We sing over your ashes. And when we finish, the wind will not find even the

memory of what you were. You will exist only as we permit you to be remembered—and we choose silence."

APPENDIX: IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR DIFFERENT SETTINGS

Medieval/Historical Realistic Setting

Adjustments needed:

Lamen vow enforced through: Hostage protocol + psychological conditioning

Edict of Contagion distributed via: Herald networks, took months to spread

Investigation methods: Traditional espionage, limited to accessible territories

Refugee tracking: Descriptions and sketches, less precise but still effective

Tempus Renascentia: Relied on natural observation, less scientific

High Fantasy/Magical Setting

Enhancements possible:

Lamen vow: Magically sealed, physically impossible to break

Edict of Contagion: Magical communication, instant global distribution

Investigation: Divination magic assists but doesn't replace human judgment

Destruction: Magical assistance for demolition, but still requires labor

Tracking: Scrying and magical identification of refugees

Science Fiction/Futuristic Setting

Enhancements possible:

Lamen vow: Neural locks, technological memory isolation

Edict of Contagion: Instant galactic broadcast, AI enforcement of tracking

Investigation: Surveillance technology, data mining, but human judgment remains crucial

Destruction: Advanced demolition, orbital bombardment for remote areas

Refugee tracking: Biometric databases, facial recognition, DNA markers

Tempus Renascentia: Accelerated ecological restoration technology

Universal Constants (All Settings)

Regardless of technology level, these remain consistent:

Unanimous council decision required

Lamens must study culture deeply before destruction

Refugees flee but have nowhere to go

Psychological trauma makes testimony unreliable

The ritual takes years, not days

Perfect erasure is acknowledged as impossible

The goal is conditional existence, not literal disappearance
