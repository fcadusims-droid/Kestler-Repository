üéØ What is the WIP Method {#what-is}

The WIP Method (Interactive Worldbuilding through Personification) is a narrative creation technique that builds
fictional universes from the inside out, using dramatized scenes and characters as discovery tools.

Core Principle

Instead of starting with maps, timelines, or lore documents, you begin with a simple scene and use characters as
"oracles" that reveal the world through dialogue, questions, and contextualized answers.

The Differentiator

Real-time dramatization: the world emerges through living scenes
Characters as tools: each character carries knowledge of the world
Organic discovery: you explore the universe as if you were inside it
AI as co-creator: uses artificial intelligence to interpret characters and expand details

üß† Foundations and Philosophy {#foundations}

Why does this method work?

1. Removes blank page paralysis Starting with "create a fantasy world" is paralyzing. Starting with "a king is in his war
room" is concrete and actionable.

2. Activates narrative creativity Your brain already knows how to create dialogues and scenes. The method uses this
natural ability to build worlds.

3. Generates internal coherence Since everything emerges from specific situations, details tend to be consistent with
the context.

4. Maintains emotional engagement You're not filling out forms ‚Äî you're living moments within the world.

Who is it ideal for?

Writers who think intuitively rather than analytically
Creators who prefer discovering over planning
People with backgrounds in theater, RPG, or improv
Those who feel blocked by traditional worldbuilding methods
Authors who want to use AI creatively and collaboratively

üõ† Initial Preparation {#preparation}

What you need

Minimum:

A document or notebook to record discoveries
Access to a conversational AI (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) ‚Äî optional but recommended
A vague idea of the genre (fantasy, sci-fi, historical, etc.)

Recommended:

Organized note-taking system (Notion, Obsidian, or even simple folders)
Method for recording inconsistencies and reviewing them later
Exploratory mindset (there are no "wrong" answers)

Defining the Initial Tone

Before starting, answer mentally:

1. What genre? (medieval fantasy, space opera, gothic horror, etc.)
2. What tone? (dark, heroic, political, mystical, comedic?)
3. What scale? (a city, a kingdom, a planet, a galaxy?)

These answers aren't fixed ‚Äî they can change as you explore.

üé¨ Step-by-Step Guide {#step-by-step}

STEP 1: Choose an Anchor Scene

Create a simple situation with a generic character in a routine action.

Examples of anchor scenes:

A king signing decrees in his throne room
A general planning a military campaign
A merchant organizing caravans
A priestess performing a ritual
A scientist examining a discovery
A ship captain checking space routes

Characteristics of a good anchor scene:

‚úÖ Involves someone with knowledge of the world (leader, traveler, scholar)
‚úÖ Is doing something that requires information (planning, deciding, studying)
‚úÖ Has potential for dialogue or reflection
‚ùå Avoid overly emotional or personal scenes at the start

STEP 2: Create an Interlocutor

Add a second character who can answer questions.

Useful types of interlocutors:

Counselor/Advisor: knows about politics, history, strategy
Servant/Assistant: knows practical day-to-day details
Traveler/Merchant: brings information from other regions
Scholar/Master: explains magic, technology, philosophy
Soldier/Guard: military and border perspective

Tip: The interlocutor should know different things from the main character.

STEP 3: Ask the First Question

The main character asks a simple question that requires description of the world.

Ideal structure:

[Character]: "[Question about geography/climate/people/resource]?"
[Character]: "[Question about geography/climate/people/resource]?"

Examples of first questions:

"How are the northern hills? Can we farm there?"
"How long does it take to reach the capital by ship?"
"What kind of people inhabit the Lowlands?"
"Are the energy crystals depleting in the mines?"

What makes a question effective:

‚úÖ Specific enough to generate details
‚úÖ Open enough to allow creativity
‚úÖ Relevant to the scene's situation
‚úÖ Would naturally arise in that context

STEP 4: Generate the Answer (by AI or Intuition)

Now the interlocutor responds. If using AI, you ask it to interpret the character. If alone, you answer intuitively.

Example prompt for AI:

You are Royal Counselor Aldric, an elderly and pragmatic man who has served the
You are Royal Counselor Aldric, an elderly and pragmatic man who has served the
king for 30 years. The king asks: "How are the hills to the north? Can we farm there?"
king for 30 years. The king asks: "How are the hills to the north? Can we farm there?"

Respond as Aldric would respond, providing details about geography, climate, and
Respond as Aldric would respond, providing details about geography, climate, and
possibilities, maintaining a respectful but direct tone.
possibilities, maintaining a respectful but direct tone.

Example response: "Your Majesty, the Iron Hills are harsh and cold even in summer. The soil is shallow, with much
gravel and stone. Pine trees grow there, but no grain we've tried has taken root. However, there is ore ‚Äî good quality
iron, and some say they've seen silver veins in the deeper valleys."

Record immediately: Iron Hills = cold, rocky, pine trees, iron, possible silver, no agriculture.

STEP 5: Expand in Layers

Ask follow-up questions based on the previous answer.

Example of layered expansion:

1st Question: "What are the Iron Hills like?"
1st Question: "What are the Iron Hills like?"
‚Üí Answer: Cold, rocky, with ore
‚Üí Answer: Cold, rocky, with ore

2nd Question: "Who works the mines there?"
2nd Question: "Who works the mines there?"
‚Üí Answer: Traditional mining clans, own culture
‚Üí Answer: Traditional mining clans, own culture

3rd Question: "Are these clans loyal to the crown?"
3rd Question: "Are these clans loyal to the crown?"
‚Üí Answer: Complex relationship, semi-independent
‚Üí Answer: Complex relationship, semi-independent

4th Question: "What was the last conflict between the crown and the miners?"
4th Question: "What was the last conflict between the crown and the miners?"
‚Üí Answer: History of an ore tax, 15 years ago
‚Üí Answer: History of an ore tax, 15 years ago

See how a geographical detail transformed into culture, politics, and history.

STEP 6: Change Scene When Saturated

When a scene has revealed enough, create a new anchor scene in another context.

Example of progression:

1. King in throne room (politics and general geography)
2. Guard captain in barracks (military details and borders)
3. Merchant at port (trade, other nations, economy)
4. Mage in tower (magic system, ancient history)

Each new scene adds a different layer to the world.

STEP 7: Connect the Scenes

Look for points where information connects.

Example:

The king mentioned ore in the Iron Hills
The merchant mentions that "iron tools from the Hills" are exported
The captain mentions that "armor from the Hills is the best"

These connections validate and reinforce the world's coherence.

ü§ñ Working with AI {#working-with-ai}

Advanced Techniques with AI

1. Multiple Perspectives Ask the same question to different characters:

King: "Are the Lowlands rich or poor?"
Merchant: "Are the Lowlands profitable for trade?"
Peasant: "What's it like living in the Lowlands?"

Different answers reveal different truths about the world.

2. Intentional Contradictions If AI generates an inconsistency, you can:

Treat it as misinformation from a character
Use it as a mystery to be explored
Transform it into political conflict (factions with different versions)

3. Thematic Sessions Dedicate an entire conversation with AI to a single aspect:

A session only about geography and climate
A session only about magic system
A session only about military history

4. "Interviews" with Specialists Create scenes where you interview specialized NPCs:

Alchemist explains local chemistry/alchemy
Ship captain explains navigation and oceans
Priest explains religions and cosmology

Maintaining Consistency

Create a "Master Document" that AI can consult:

Each time you start a new session, include in the prompt:
Each time you start a new session, include in the prompt:
"Here are the established facts about this world:
"Here are the established facts about this world:

Update this document after each session.

üìö Complete Examples {#examples}

Example 1: Medieval Fantasy - Kingdom of Valdris

ANCHOR SCENE: King Aldric sat in his private chamber, studying ancient maps. Beside him, Counselor Theron
observed in silence.

DISCOVERY DIALOGUE:

King: "Theron, these markings on the map... what are these towers along the Western Frontier?"

Theron: "Those are the Ancient Vigils, my lord. Twenty-three stone towers built over three hundred years ago, when the
Empire still ruled these lands. Today, seventeen still stand. The others... ruins overtaken by vegetation."

World Record:

Western Frontier exists
Ancient Vigils: 23 original towers, 17 intact
Built 300+ years ago by an Empire (now fallen)
Ruins visible in the landscape

King: "Who maintains these towers now?"

Theron: "A patchwork of loyalties, I'm afraid. The Raven Tower is maintained by House Blackmere. The Wind Tower,
by the wandering knights of the Grey Order. Some... well, some have no guard at all. They're shelter for smugglers and
fugitives."

World Record:

House Blackmere: noble, controls Raven Tower
Grey Order: wandering knights, control Wind Tower
Western Frontier is porous, poorly controlled
Smuggling is a problem

King: "And what do they guard? What were they built against?"

Theron: "The records speak of the Grey Hordes ‚Äî nomadic tribes from beyond the Shadow Mountains. But it's been
generations since they crossed the borders in force. Today... today they guard more against our own problems, I think.
Refugees from the south, deserters, occasional bands of raiders."

World Record:

Grey Hordes: nomadic tribes, east of Shadow Mountains
Not a current active threat
South has problems (generating refugees)

Deserters and bandits are internal threats

Example 2: Science Fiction - Colony Epsilon-9

ANCHOR SCENE: Commander Sato stood in the control center of Station Epsilon-9, reviewing mining reports.
Technician Li entered with updated data.

DISCOVERY DIALOGUE:

Sato: "Li, the Outer Belt yield dropped 12% this month. What's happening?"

Li: "Particle storms, commander. Solar wind is above predicted levels for this phase of the Kepler-442 cycle. Mining
teams are having to anchor the platforms every six hours instead of once per shift."

World Record:

Station Epsilon-9: administrative center
Outer Belt: mining zone
Star Kepler-442: has solar wind cycles
Mining on mobile platforms requiring anchoring
Particle storms are operational challenge

Sato: "How long until the next phase?"

Li: "Three weeks, if Dr. Okonkwo's models are correct. But the last storm arrived four days earlier than predicted. The
models... we're still learning this system."

World Record:

Dr. Okonkwo: scientist, specialist in stellar models
Colony is relatively new (still learning the system)
Predictions are imprecise
There's an element of risk/unpredictability

Sato: "And the crews? How's morale?"

Li: "Tense. Nobody expected to work double shifts already in the second quarter. And there are rumors the Corporation
is considering extending contracts."

World Record:

Corporate operation (not military or governmental)
Temporary work contracts
Morale is low
Expectations aren't being met
Corporation has decision-making power over contracts

Example 3: Gothic Horror - Blackwood Manor

ANCHOR SCENE: Lady Blackwood stood in the library, running her fingers over the spines of ancient volumes. The
housekeeper, Mrs. Halloway, entered silently.

DISCOVERY DIALOGUE:

Lady Blackwood: "Mrs. Halloway, how long has it been since anyone opened the East Wing?"

Mrs. Halloway: "Since the winter when Your Ladyship was a child. Your grandfather ordered the doors locked after...
the incident."

World Record:

Blackwood Manor has a closed East Wing
Closed approximately 20-30 years ago
An "incident" occurred
Lady Blackwood's grandfather ordered the closure

Lady Blackwood: "My grandfather never told me what happened. Do you know?"

Mrs. Halloway: (hesitant) "There are rumors, milady. They say Your Ladyship's aunt, Lady Catherine, fell ill in that
wing. A fever that... changed her mind. When she passed, her last request was for the wing to be sealed."

World Record:

Lady Catherine: Lady Blackwood's aunt (deceased)
Died of mysterious illness with mental symptoms
Her own request: seal the wing
Nature of illness unclear (rumors)

Lady Blackwood: "And the servants? Do they talk about that wing?"

Mrs. Halloway: "Not in my presence, milady. But I once heard one of the maids saying she saw light in the East Wing
windows. Of course, I reprimanded her severely. Locked windows don't light themselves."

World Record:

Servants have superstitions/fears about the Wing
Reports of unexplained phenomena (lights)
Mrs. Halloway is skeptical but clearly uncomfortable
Atmosphere of secrecy and fear permeates the house

üìä Organizing Your World {#organizing}

Recommended Note-Taking System

üîß Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

Problem 1: "The information is contradictory"

Solution A - Simple Retcon: Choose the version that makes more sense and note the correction.

Solution B - Turn into Mystery: Use the contradiction as an element of the world.

"Some say the war lasted 10 years, others say 15. Why?"
Official vs. real histories
Different perceptions from different cultures

Solution C - Incorrect Character Information: That character was wrong or lying. Simple.

Problem 2: "I've lost track of everything I created"

Prevention:

Make summaries every 3-5 sessions
Create a "Quick Reference Sheet" with the 10-15 most important facts

Correction:

Have a session dedicated only to reviewing and organizing
Use AI to help: "Here are my raw notes. Help me organize them by theme."

Problem 3: "AI is generating very generic things"

Cause: Vague prompts or lack of constraints.

Solution:

Be more specific about tone and style
Give examples of what you want
Add constraints: "Avoid clich√©s like 'evil empire' or 'ancient prophecy'"
Use references: "The tone should resemble [work you like]"

Problem 4: "I don't know what question to ask now"

Use this list of triggers:

Geography:

What's the climate like in [location]?
What's to the [north/south/east/west] of [location]?
How long does it take to travel from X to Y?
What natural resources exist in [region]?

Politics:

Who governs [location]?
What's the relationship between [faction A] and [faction B]?
What laws or traditions are unique here?
What problems does the current government face?

History:

What happened here [10/50/100] years ago?
Why does [structure/tradition] exist?
Who built [ruin/monument]?
What conflicts marked this land?

Culture:

How do people here make a living?
What festivals or rituals do they practice?
What do they consider taboo?
How do they treat foreigners?

Mystery:

What local legends exist?
What are people afraid of here?
Is there any place they avoid?
What ancient secrets might be hidden?

Problem 5: "The world is getting too big"

Solution:

Focus on one region first. You don't need to create the entire world.
Use "fog of war." Everything beyond the main region exists vaguely, but not detailed.
Create only what's relevant to your stories.

Problem 6: "I can't visualize what I create"

Solution:

Ask AI to describe visually: "Visually describe what it would be like to stand in the Central Square of Valdris at
noon."
Use image AI to generate visual references (Midjourney, DALL-E, etc.)
Search for real reference images that approximate

Example: A noble and a merchant argue about raising import taxes. Each reveals different aspects of the economy,
politics, and social values.

‚öñ When to Use (and When Not to Use) {#when-to-use}

‚úÖ Use the WIP Method when:

You're starting from scratch and don't know where to begin
Traditional methods block you (maps, sheets, timelines)
You think narratively rather than analytically
Your world needs internal coherence above all
You want to discover surprises in the creation process itself
You have facility with dialogues and dramatized thinking
You prefer exploring over rigidly planning
You want to use AI creatively and collaboratively
Your project is character-oriented more than system-oriented
You need emotional engagement to maintain motivation

‚ùå DON'T use (or adapt) the WIP Method when:

You need maps and complex systems from the start (e.g., wargames, strategy)
Your world requires rigorous mathematical/scientific consistency (hard sci-fi with precise physics)
You already have an established world and just want to expand (use for new areas, not to revise)
You prefer working alone without AI and have difficulty with improv (still possible, but harder)
Your project requires technical documentation from the start (tabletop RPG with rules, for example)
You think very visually/spatially and need to see maps to process
You have a tight deadline and rigid structure (the method is more exploratory and can take time)

üîÑ Can Combine with Other Methods:

The WIP works well alongside:

Traditional top-down worldbuilding: use WIP to fill in details after having the general structure
Maps: create the map after exploring regions via dialogues
Character sheets: NPCs created in WIP become full characters later
Wiki/Codex: organize WIP discoveries in encyclopedic format afterwards

üéØ Conclusion

The WIP Method doesn't replace all forms of worldbuilding ‚Äî it's an additional tool in the creative arsenal. Its strength
lies in:

1. Removing initial blocks through dramatization
2. Creating coherent worlds from the inside out
3. Maintaining emotional engagement during the process
4. Allowing organic discovery instead of forced construction
5. Using AI as a creative partner in a structured way

Next Steps

1. Experiment with a simple scene ‚Äî just 15 minutes
2. Don't worry about perfection ‚Äî you can organize later
3. Trust the process ‚Äî the world reveals itself gradually
4. Record everything ‚Äî small details become important
5. Have fun ‚Äî if it's not enjoyable, adjust the approach

Remember: Every great world started with a single idea, a single scene, a single question. The WIP Method simply
structures that journey of discovery.

Happy creating! üåç‚ú®
