Kestler Repository

Welcome to the Kestler Repository, a creative archive built to share imagination freely with the world.
Here you’ll find original works created by João Vitor Perazzolo, also known as Johnny Kestler — a place where art, stories, and ideas come together to inspire others.

This repository exists with an open spirit. Everything shared here is meant to be explored, remixed, reimagined, and expanded upon. The goal is simple: to keep creativity alive, open, and accessible to everyone who wants to create something new.

Feel free to use these works as inspiration for your own projects — whether you’re an artist, writer, developer, or dreamer.
